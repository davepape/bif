need to do proper htmlspecialchars etc on ALL variables being output

search proposals

add 'change festival contact'

force batch names to be unique; allow editing batch name

fix init-basic setting of festival data

maybe change venues to have a status value, rather than deleted flag
    - confirmed, maybe, not-this-year (but then this should somehow be tied to festival id)

user privileges should be per festival - ie need to make a table with userid / festivalid / privileges

? share proposal-ownership command?

newGroupshow command should redirect you to the group show's page on success
